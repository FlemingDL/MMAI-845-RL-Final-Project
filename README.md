# Team Fleming MMAI 845 Reinforcement Learning Final Project
This is team Fleming's reinforcement learning final project.

## Getting Started
Te get setup first clone the repository into a new directory
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/FlemingDL/MMAI-845-RL-Final-Project.git
```
## Editing your notebook
Always make sure you have the latest code from the server before making any changes.  To ensure you have the
latest changes enter:
```bash
$ git pull
```
After you make changes to your notebook, you need to stage your changes.  Enter git add followed by the file name (do
not include the angle brackets).
```bash
$ git add <name of your file.ipynb>
```
To captures a snapshot your file's currently staged changes.  Enter the following:
```bash
$ git commit -m "Enter a brief message explaining your update"
```
You are now ready to push your changes to the server.  To do, enter:
```bash
$ git push
```
Remember to always do a git pull before making edits (it's not that big of a deal if you don't but
will make your life easier when get started)
```bash
$ git pull
```
## Adding a new notebook
The process is pretty much the same as above.  Ensure you have the latest code:
```bash
$ git pull
```
Use git add to add the file:
 ```bash
$ git add <name of new file.ipynb>
```
Use git commit to stage the changes:
```bash
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
Push the changes
```bash
$ git push
```
